# TerminalTextEditor
Basic text editor built with C++ and ncurses. 
Cursor is a bit buggy when creating new lines sometimes, pressing the up and down arrow keys should fix it.
Cursor can also bug out a bit if you do not move it to the end of line before changing lines. Same fix, press up and down till it positions itself to the end of line.
If the cursor bugs out there's a chance the program can crash.
